# The New NBPS Student Government

This is the NewNB Project; dedicated to replacing the currently broken Student Government with a community-driven alternative.

## What's the Point?

The current Student Government of North Broward Prep is flawed in many aspects. Here are just a few:
* there is systematic discrimination against those who aren't already in the system (a.k.a. nepotism)
* the Student Legislators and Class Officers are lazy and don't get anything done
* the Student Government is nothing like a real government, meaning that the Student Government is just a massive waste of time for its participants since they don't learn anything from it and are essentially doing the Administration's job

And that's just a slice of the almost unbelivable incompetence of the current Student Government.

The NewNB Project is meant to replace it with a much better alternative, this time:
* modeled after a real government so that people will actually gain something from the experience
* ensure that nepotism and other forms of discrimination are impossible
* make certain that the Student Legislators and Class Officers aren't able to slack off
