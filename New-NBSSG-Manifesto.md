# Preface: Our Stories
**The Student Government of the North Broward Preparatory School is an abject failure at all it wishes to accomplish.** Change is something both portions of the Student Government (the Class Officers and the Student Legislators) tout as paramount, and yet neither group appears to want to see it through. In essence, **the Class Officers are nothing more than measly party planners** and the **Student Legislators are apathetic**, lazy corner cutters who cannot seem to place any actual effort into their work. I hold these criticisms as a student involved with the Student Government for one year as a Class Officer. One year was all it took for me to become aware of the prevailing dysfunction and inaction that characterizes our Student Government. I will be the first to admit that I am not a victim of this inaction, but rather a cause. **I could have done something** to help. I could have written a bill. I could have lead an organized effort to make change while I was still in the Student Government. Instead, **I did nothing**. And for that, **I am sorry**. I sincerely apologize to the Administration, my fellow Student Government members, and, most importantly, to the Student Body. I have let you all down. But apologies are worthless. They are nothing but words; they cannot remedy the problem that I helped create. Instead, I hope that you all will take this proposal, my effort to clean up this mess, as my apology. All I ask of you is to at least skim through this proposal and sign it. **By merely stroking your pen, whether it be digital or physical, you can bring me one step closer to killing this beast I helped create.**

# Proposal to Amend the Current Student Government
## Introduction
We, the undersigned, declare the current Student Government of the North Broward Preparatory School (henceforth “the School”) to be an abject failure in all important aspects, and demand the complete replacement of said Student Government with one that is

```
A. reflective of the world around us,
B. effective at the management of the School, and
C. helpful to those desiring a career in the Political Sciences.
```

It is in the best interest of the School, and the students who attend it, that we urge the swift implementation of these proposed changes.

**Short Summary:**
* The current Student Government **systematically enforces discrimination** against those who aren’t already “in the system” (a.k.a. **nepotism**).
* The **Student Legislators are to blame for the lack of change** in the Student Government, **not the system**.
* The **Student Government inaccurately represents any real government**, in everything from bureaucratic proceedings to elections.
* The **Class Officers are lazy** and will sometimes go weeks without doing anything related to the School or the Student Government.
* *In other words*, **everything’s broken**.

This proposal is split into two sections: one describing the Student Government’s faults, and one delineating a new Student Government free of the dysfunction and fault of the current Student Government.

Please also note that all information in this proposal was written during the 2016-17 school year, and is  completely accurate in that year. If more recent information is found, it will be indicated that it is from a more recent time.

## Faults in the Current Student Government

### Background
The current Student Government is separated into two different parts: the Student Government class, consisting of class officers and appointed positions, and the Student Legislature, one legislator from each advisory class being sent to vote on legislation (“New Business”) introduced either by the Student Government class or by other legislators, or to vote on the passage of Clubs.

### Education
A school’s purpose is to prepare its students for their future careers. North Broward Prep touts an exemplary Fine Arts program and an excellent Engineering program, providing those who wish to succeed in these fields with the skills necessary to do so. While there are certainly opportunities for those hoping to pursue a Political Science career (including the AP U.S. Government course and IB Global Politics), there exist fewer of these opportunities than opportunities for Fine Arts and Engineering students. Those aspiring Political Scientists would seek solace in the school’s Student Government, only to find a Student Government that does not accurately represent any real government in the world (and is thus noneducational and unhelpful).

### Dysfunction in the Student Legislature

#### Legislation and “New Business”
The overarching purpose of the Student Legislature, as is endlessly echoed by the Student Government class, is to *make change*. Legislators theoretically would vote on introduced issues, whether it be an amendment to the Constitution, a new Club, or some other piece of legislation. This legislation could be created by any student, but must be introduced by a legislator. It has been previously demonstrated that Legislators have failed to perform this duty, as is best exemplified by only 2 pieces of legislation having been introduced into the Student Legislature in the entire 2016-17 school year (both of which were created by Class Officers). The cause for this inaction is simple: *legislators cannot be bothered to or are unable to make an effort*. A legislator may have commitments other than the Student Legislature which prevent them from putting in the required effort to make legislation, or the legislator may be indifferent. Either way, the Student Legislature is incapable of making change, leaving all measures to the Executive Board and the Class Officers (a group of people which much less accurately represents the Student Body).

#### Clubs
Clubs are Student Organizations which are organized around a specific topic or purpose. They are hosted by a faculty sponsor, who is financially rewarded by the school with an estimated $500 bonus, according to Mr. Jason Shaffer (who has left his role as Student Government advisor as of the 2017-18 school year). Clubs are under the jurisdiction of the Student Organizations committee, comprised of the Vice Presidents of the Class Officers (Executive Vice President being the head). Clubs are allowed to participate every year in the School’s Club Fair, which allows them to showcase themselves to prospective, new, and returning students alike. In order for a group of students to be recognized as a Club, they must draft a Club Charter and have it approved by the Student Organizations committee as is dictated by the Tremblay Charter Enforcement Act. What newcomers to the Student Government and the School do not know is that Clubs used to be passed by majority vote in the Student Legislature, not by the Student Organizations committee. Legislators used to have to vote on every single Charter to see whether or not it would become a Club. In the 2016-17 school year, legislators rejected one Charter. That was it. The rest, a figure between 20 and 40, were passed, and several would continue to fail within the same school year (such as the Spearfishing and Diving Club). Then, the Student Legislature voted to change this so that they did not need to address clubs. Most of these legislators (including Daniel Tremblay, Former Executive President and author of the Tremblay Charter Enforcement Act) reasoned that this would leave more time in meetings for New Business and alternative forms of legislation. What these supporters fail to address is that *there was already time for New Business in the meetings*. If legislators were truly willing to create legislation, they would have already done so. The only thing that can be reasonably attributed to the passage of the Tremblay Charter Enforcement Act is indifference.

### Dysfunction in the Student Government Class

#### Mistreatment of Appointed Position Applicants
Appointed Positions are created and managed by the Executive President nearing the end of the school year before they are sworn in, and have typically consisted of Chief of Staff, Spirit Coordinator, Residential Affairs, and other roles. At the end of each year, succeeding the Class Officer elections, a school-wide email is issued asking for applicants for these roles. The remainder of this section is the story of two of these people, who have asked to not be named, and how they were mistreated by the 2017-18 school year Executive President in their efforts to apply for the positions.

Person 1 is an ambitious student from Europe, where they were a participant in several prestigious youth Political Science programs. They started at NBPS in the 2016-17 school year, became interested in participating by learning about the Student Government from their friends. Person 1 thought they had good ideas, after all, and their friends thought so too. They originally wanted to be a Class Officer, but abstained from candidacy due to uncertainty. Finally, at the end of the year, the email for Appointed Position applications arrived in their inbox. Person 1 decided to apply, crafting an impressive resume and filling in the application. They submitted their resume long before the deadline. Person 1 waited patiently for a response, any response, from the incumbent Executive President. None came. Finally, Person 1 inquired with a Student Government member about what was taking so long. The Student Government member promptly informed him that the position was already filled by a current Student Government member. This information came without warning, and had not Person 1 decided to prod further, they would have never known that the Executive President had allowed the position they had applied for to be swooped out from underneath them.

Person 2 was a Student Legislator in the 2016-17 school year, and enjoyed having a say in Student Government proceedings. They had lost an election for Class Officer, so when the supposed “opportunity” came to apply for an Appointed Position, they leaped at it with glee, aiming for a second chance at being in the Student Government class. Person 2’s story progresses in much the same way as Person 1’s: they hear nothing back from the incumbent Executive President, instead being told by another Student Government member that they’d been duped. There is a difference, however: Person 2 provided evidence to a Student Government member that they had, indeed, submitted their application before the deadline and that it had been received (the Google Forms service was configured to automatically send a copy of the form when it was received by the incumbent Executive President back to the submitter). The correspondence with the Student Government member in question was over email, and after Person 2 sent them the evidence, no further response was received.

Another Student Government member was contacted by both Person 1 and Person 2, and decided to do some investigating on their behalf. They inquired about the incident with Stacy Amelchenko, the leading Student Government Advisor, who referred them to the 2017-18 Executive President. The Executive President then vaguely claimed that the emails “were not approved in time.” Who would need to approve them, or why they would need to be approved, is unknown.

All this leads us to believe that Persons 1 and 2 are victims of the consequences of nepotism within the Student Government, and that there may be others with stories like Persons 1 and 2.

#### Abject Apathy
The Student Government Class is a full-length class that takes up an elective. This means that on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays, the Student Government meets for 50 minutes, and on Tuesdays/Wednesdays, they meet for 1 hour and 30 minutes.

As a former Student Government recounts, “There were some days when we did literally nothing. We talked about our days and chatted about stuff, but never once did we talk about Student Government-related things. Sometimes these days became weeks.”

This is only one example of the apathy demonstrated by the Class Officers (and, to an extent, the Student Government Advisors). Their inactivity in the Student Legislature is also a prime example.

Several times during the 2016-17 year, the Class Officers stated their interest in motivating the disinterested Student Legislators to write actual legislation instead of just passing Club Charters. Several bills were in the works, including a resolution meant to bring the dismal state of the Lakeside Hall bathrooms to light. Sadly, the only bill that ever made it in front of the Legislators was the Tremblay Charter Enforcement Act. The countless other bills were forgotten.

## The New North Broward Student Government
## Below, find the proposed new constitution of the North Broward Prep Student Government.
We the Students of North Broward, in order to form a more perfect self-governing body, express our will to the Administration and other superior entities, and take action to improve the general well-being, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the North Broward Preparatory School Student Government.

## Article. I.
### Section. 1.
All legislative powers herein shall be vested in a Congress of North Broward, consisting of a Senate and House of Representatives.

### Section. 2.
The House shall be composed of Representatives chosen every third Wednesday of September by the Students of the several Advisories. The Students of the Advisories will choose 1 (one) Representative to represent them in the House.

The Representatives will meet once every 2 weeks, beginning one week after the Representatives are elected.

### Section. 3.
The Senate shall be composed of Senators chosen every second Wednesday of September by the Students of the 4 (four) Grades. The Students of the Grades shall choose 2 (two) Senators to represent their Grade in the Senate.

The Senators will meet once every 2 weeks, beginning one week after the Senators are elected.

### Section. 4.
Candidates for Representative shall be elected on using the traditional system: the Candidate who amasses more than 50% of the vote is the decisive winner. Each Advisor will poll the Students of their Advisory in any manner they so please (given that their chosen method is free from bias), and they will report the results of their poll to the Student Government Advisors.

Candidates for Senator shall be elected in

A Special Election will occur when a Representative or Senator must be replaced.

If a Representative is to be replaced, the Advisor of that Representative will conduct a poll of their Students as to who shall replace the Representative. This poll will follow the same stipulations as a standard Election, and its results must be reported to the Student Government Advisors.

If a Senator is to be replaced, the Administration will conduct a ballot for their replacement within 2 (two) weeks. Those who desire the position will have 1 (one) week to declare candidacy, and the remaining time until the ballot to campaign.

### Section. 5.
Students may apply for candidacy for either Representative or Senator. However, they cannot hold both positions at the same time. By declaring candidacy, the Student assures that they shall, if elected,
* attend every meeting (with the exception of an affliction preventing attendance),
* honor the Honor Code,
* obey the will of the Students whom they Represent, and
* abide by this Constitution

If a Representative fails to meet these requirements, they are to be immediately dismissed from their role and replaced within 2 (two) weeks via Special Election.
